# Secure Password Management System

Academic cybersecurity project developed as part of the Cybersecurity Technologist program (UTU).

## Description
Secure password management system implemented using Python and MySQL. The system allows
user registration, password validation based on security policies, secure storage using
SHA-256 hashing with salt, and relational database management.

## Features
- User registration and credential management
- Password strength validation
- Password policy enforcement
- Secure password storage using SHA-256 hashing with salt
- Password history tracking
- Secure password generation
- Console-based application

## Database Design
- Entity-Relationship model
- Relational schema in Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Referential integrity using foreign keys

## Technologies
- Python
- MySQL
- SQL (DDL, DML, CRUD)
- Hashlib (SHA-256)

## Cybersecurity Concepts
- Authentication
- Secure credential storage
